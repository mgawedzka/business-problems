            <h2> Use alt tags to describe an image on a website, which are read aloud by a screen reader for people with a visual impairment. In addition, you should put periods in abbreviations to make it readeable by the screen reader, for example D.W.P. for Department of Work and Pensions. You can create subtitles and transcripts for videos using youtube tools. Links embedded on the website should be clearly described, insted of just saying click-here for more information. It is useful to underline your links using contrasting colors to make the link visible for colorblind web-users. The choice of colors can make website difficult to read for colorblind users who can't see yellow, green, and blue. The best practice is to use black text on a white background,   </h2>
